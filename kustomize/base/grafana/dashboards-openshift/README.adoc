= OpenShift dashboards

These Grafana dashboards were copied from source of https://github.com/openshift/cluster-monitoring-operator/blob/release-4.10/assets/grafana/dashboard-definitions.yaml[cluster-monitoring-operator]. 

* Namespace, labels and annotations were removed from the ConfigMaps as they are not relevant outside the context of an OpenShift distribution.
* `dashboards-ocp410.yaml` is for OpenShift v4.10, while `dashboards-ocp410.yaml` is for OpenShift v4.11
** The only one line difference is using `cluster:node_cpu:ratio_rate5m` in _grafana-dashboard-k8s-resources-cluster_
* These dashboards are no longer maintained after OpenShift v4.11, so additional work is needed to make them work on newer versions

The dashboards work fine deployed to the cluster scoped Grafana instance to visualize standard OpenShift "infra" metrics

* Some dashboards also work in namespace scoped Grafana. 
** Remove existing `namespace=~` filters to avoid "Bad Request".
